[Giza Agent for Staking to Predicted Operator](https://github.com/ashu0x/giza-thon/blob/main/operator_agent/agent.py)

Staking is one of the primary methods for generating income for tokens such as ETH. Currently, about 60% of ETH is used inside of LST/LRT protocols. This means that the risk of slashing is becoming increasingly significant for Ethereum tokenomics. 

However, predicting such events is still an unresolved issue that could help act proactively and alert node operators to potential critical decreases in their performance score.

We propose slashing predictions for validators and operators(Eigenlayer).
